## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `itu_tables` module: 16 small ITU-T G.723.1 bit-exact tables vendored
  from `docs/audio/g7231/tables/` into a new `tables/` directory of
  this crate and exposed as `OnceLock`-cached `pub fn name() ->
  &'static [T; N]` accessors. Covers the LPC analysis primitives
  (Hamming window, binomial lag window, bandwidth-expansion factors,
  LSP cosine lookup), the LSP layout tables (DC-predicted frequencies,
  band-info), the perceptual-weighting & post-filter pole/zero
  coefficients, highpass-filter constants, gain-quantiser decision
  factors, the bit-allocation segment table, and the MP-MLQ
  pulse-count / max-position tables. 14 unit tests cover spot-values,
  monotonicity / period / partition invariants, and accessor caching.
- `tables/README.md`: per-table inventory mirroring the workspace
  source-of-truth in `docs/audio/g7231/tables/`, with the *Feist v.
  Rural* legal basis spelled out.
- README §"Numeric-table staging (round 171)": documents the new
  module and clarifies that the tables are staged but not yet wired
  into the encoder / decoder bodies.

## [0.0.6](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-g7231/compare/v0.0.5...v0.0.6) - 2026-05-06

### Other

- drop stale REGISTRARS / with_all_features intra-doc links
- drop dead `linkme` dep
- registry calls: rename make_decoder/make_encoder → first_decoder/first_encoder
- auto-register via oxideav_core::register! macro (linkme distributed slice)
- unify entry point on register(&mut RuntimeContext) ([#502](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-g7231/pull/502))
- replace never-match regex with semver_check = false
- migrate to centralized OxideAV/.github reusable workflows
- drop unused SampleFormat / TimeBase imports (slim-frame leftover)
- adopt slim VideoFrame/AudioFrame shape
- pin release-plz to patch-only bumps

### Changed

- **`register` entry point unified on `RuntimeContext`** (task #502).
  The legacy `pub fn register(reg: &mut CodecRegistry)` is renamed to
  `register_codecs` and a new `pub fn register(ctx: &mut
  oxideav_core::RuntimeContext)` calls it internally. Breaking change
  for direct callers passing a `CodecRegistry`; switch to either the
  new `RuntimeContext` entry or the explicit `register_codecs` name.

## [0.0.5](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-g7231/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5) - 2026-04-25

### Other

- add decoder post-filter + frame-erasure concealment
- update encoder module docstring to match current pipeline
- README reflects full-synthesis decoder + round-trip PSNR
- joint gain-pair refinement + MP-MLQ coord-descent tidy
- promote stateful decoder + coordinate-descent pulse search
- fix lsp_to_lpc p/2 buffer truncation + rework encoder-decoder sync
- drop Cargo.lock — this crate is a library
- bump oxideav-core / oxideav-codec dep examples to "0.1"
- bump to oxideav-core 0.1.1 + codec 0.1.1
